## To-Do List Application (React)

This is a simple to-do list application built with React that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and filter tasks based on their status. The app also features a dark/light mode toggle for a customizable user experience. It uses `json-server` to handle task data and `React-modal` for modal dialogs.

### Features

- **Fetch and display to-do notes**: Retrieve tasks from a server and display them in the app.
- **Filter displayed to-do notes**: Use the search bar and dropdown filter to display all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks (Client-side filtering).
- **Mark to-do as completed**: Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- **Delete a to-do**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Create a new to-do**: Add new tasks to the list.
- **Toggle dark/light scheme**: Switch between dark and light modes for a better visual experience.
